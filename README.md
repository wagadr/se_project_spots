## Sprint 6 Stage 9 Project Spots

This project was intended to learn how to successfully make a functional webpage with the ability to edit and upload information and new cards, as well as validate newly inputted information and show clear, concise error messages on the user side to help resolve any issues.

The previous project (design only) was made into a functional, usable webpage using javascript.
